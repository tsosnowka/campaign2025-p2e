Wydawało się, że Edonia, pomimo pewnych zawirowań politycznych, przeszła ten okres we względnym spokoju, wręcz z łatką 'silnego państwa', które radziło sobie z buntami, wojnami domowymi, a nawet zakusami zawistnych sąsiadów. Jak się później okazało, za potęgą Edonii stała <a data-href=\"Rada Visceromantów\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rada Visceromantów</a>, której udało się ujarzmić moc <a data-href=\"Gandrowie\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gandrowie</a>. Wieszczyło to jednak początek upadku Edonii. Państwo nadwyrężone przez silne działanie klątwy na wschodzie i zachodzie, wybuch kolejnego konfliktu na południu, nie było w stanie przetrwać ciosu, jakim było wyzwolenie się <a data-href=\"Gandrowie\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gandrowie</a> z sideł rady oraz kompletnie niespodziewaną inwazją demonów. Edonia do dziś odczuwa skutki tych wydarzeń.

Pochodzi ze stosunkowo młodego rodu w Edonii - potomków ludów, które przybyły tu z północy zaraz po zakończeniu <a data-href=\"Czas Klątwy\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Czas Klątwy</a>. Jego wojownicze plemię bardzo szybko odnalazło się w chaosie, jaki ogarnął te ziemie po serii klęsk. Ralgridh rządzi twardą, pewną ręką. Za jego kadencji państwo cieszy się największą stabilnością od kilkudziesięciu lat. Wzmocnił granice, zbudował silną, karną armię, bardzo krótko trzyma <a data-href=\"Rada Visceromantów\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rada Visceromantów</a> pamiętając, do czego doprowadziły jej knowania cztery wieki temu. Nie zapomina również o sojuszu łaczącym go z <a data-href=\"Perhyn\" href=\"places/countries/perhyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perhyn</a>, mimo, że w Edonii zmieniali się władcy, a nawet całe rody u steru państwa, sojusz z krajem Półwyspu nadal jest odnawiany. Sama Edonia obecnie jest podzielona na regiony, którymi rządzą namiestnicy - desygnowani osobiście przez króla. Każdy posiada właściwie władzę absolutną na swoich włościach. Winni są swojemu władcy wystawiać armie na jego żądanie i stawiać się na zebrania rady - ciała doradczego przy królu. Sam władca posiada również kilka wydzielonych domen w centrum państwa, rozplanowanych tak, by graniczyły z ziemiami jego namiestników. Religia<br>\nEdończycy od końca <a data-href=\"Czas Klątwy\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Czas Klątwy</a> oddają cześć głównemu panteonowi. Szczególną zaś cześć oddają <a data-href=\"Aquilla\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aquilla</a>, nadając jej przydomki Obrończyni i Córka Smoków. Wielu Edończyków dołącza do <a data-href=\"Zakon Beithira\" href=\"others/zakon-beithira.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zakon Beithira</a> - są najliczniejszą narodowością w tej apolitycznej organizacji. Z gór dalekiej północy, wraz z plemionami, do Edonii przybyło wiele tamtejszych wierzeń, wzbogacając religijny koloryt tych ziem. Dzisiejszy Edończyk modli się do panteonu, ale nie zapomina również o złożeniu ofiary <a data-href=\"Rotaskr\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rotaskr</a> przed wyruszeniem na trakt. Poddani\nPaństwo jest mocno podzielone pod względem etnicznym. W wyniku wyniszczenia ogromnych mas ludności w czasie kryzysu, w Edonii powstała luka, którą zapełniły ludy graniczne. Najliczniejszą grupą były plemiona z północy. W roku 3759, w momencie, gdy wycofano dużą część wojsk chroniących te granice federacja plemion pod wodzą Sigesara przedarła się i osiedliła na północnych rubieżach, początkowo zupełnie nie niepokojona przez rząd. Natywna ludność tych ziem opuściła swoje domy ze strachu przed hordą, przesuwając się do centrum kraju. Edonia w tym czasie nie miała sił walczyć z najeźdźcą. Lokalna szlachta, wspierana jedynie przez niezwykle kruche siły królewskie próbowała walczyć z barbarzyńcami, ale była zwyczajnie zbyt słaba. Ostatecznie przyjęto upokarzający dla króla Isgraela(syna Jarrela) pakt, który oddawał północną rubież we władanie plemionom, nakładając jednocześnie na nie obowiązek płacenia podatków i obrony granic. Migracja ludów w pozostałych częściach była nieco mniejsza, jednak na tyle znacząca, że obecne państwo zachowało jedynie okło 30% autochtonicznych mieszkańców. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nEdonia ma bardzo burzliwą historię. Podczas <a data-href=\"Czas Klątwy\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Czas Klątwy</a> władzę w państwie przejął hrabia Jarrel - rozpoczynając nową linię królewską. Hrabia był protegowanym Arho, głowy <a data-href=\"Rada Visceromantów\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rada Visceromantów</a>, a także sojusznikiem odradzającego się państwa <a data-href=\"Renoc\" href=\"people/renoc.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Renoc</a>. Król przejął władzę w zniszczonym państwie. Jego krótkie rządy(ze względu na podeszły wiek) upłynęły pod znakiem wzmacniania granic i odbudowy zniszczonych ziem. W międzyczasie wzmacniała się pozycja Północnej Rubieży i tamtejszych plemion. Po powstrzymaniu inwazji ogrów pod wodzą Bikuhra, szlachta plemion weszła na dwór. Ich talent militarny i zaprawienie w bojach zostały docenione poprzez nobilitacje najznamienitszych rodów. Dearallowi, ówczesnemu władcy Edonii i wnukowi Jarrela, nie podobała się niezależność tych obcych wojsk. Korzystając z odradzającej się potęgi <a data-href=\"Rada Visceromantów\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rada Visceromantów</a>, chciał zmusić szlachtę plemion do posłuchu. Spisek został jednak wykryty i wybuchł buntem, podsycanym nieudolnością króla i zwycięską chwałą plemion. Dearall zginął, a władzę szybko przejął potomek Sigesara - Bolcor. Tym samym władza nad Edonią przeszła w ręce plemion. Nie zakończyło to jednak problemów państwa. Plemiona nie stanowiły jednorodnego bytu, wiele klanów wewnętrznie walczyło o przywództwo. Po przejęciu Edonii rozpoczął się okres wzrastu potęgi najsilniejszych rodów. Rzecz jasna, doprowadziło do kolejnych tarć. Wszystko było dodatkowo podsycane przez stare rody Edonii, którym na rękę było osłabienie obecnej władzy i chaos w kraju, licząc na łut szczęścia, który pozwoliłby pozbyć się intruzów z tronu. Po kilku latach prowokacji i pomniejszych utarczek zamordowany zostaje syn Bolcora - Hrurbaef. Do dzisiaj nie wiadomo kto wysłał skrytobójcę po głowę władcy. Całe państwo stanęło w ogniu. Jednocześnie swoje pretensje do korony zgłosiło czterech przywódców klanów. Niedawno odbudowany kraj znów wpadł w spiralę chaosu, która trwała niemalże równe dziesięć lat. Wojna domowa wyniszcza i po raz kolejny osłabia to niegdyś potężne państwo. Na czele tego giganta na glinianych nogach staje Tavuth - generał armii południowych, rozpoczynając linię władców rządzących do dziś. Wojna domowa została wykorzystana przez jednego z sąsiadów Edonii - państwo rządzone przez klany krasnoludów - <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a>. W ostatnich latach ich kraj bardzo szybko się rozrastał, ponoć ma to związek z czymś, co ich górnicy odnaleźli w korzeniach gór. Tak czy inaczej, pomimo pomocy udzielonej Edonii przez <a data-href=\"Perhyn\" href=\"places/countries/perhyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perhyn</a> i <a data-href=\"Yanthalei\" href=\"places/countries/yanthalei.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yanthalei</a> krasnalom udało się zawładnąć ogromnymi połaciami południowych ziem(liczy się, że nawet około 1/4 wszystkich terytoriów).

Orphne, najmłodsze dziecko Junn i Renoca, urodziła się w 3789(w momencie początku kampanii ma 326 lat). Niektórzy, źródła wszystkich jej przewin doszukiwali się właśnie w samych okolicznościach narodzin. Została ukuta teoria, według której ascendencja Junn odbiła się niszczycielsko na najmłodszej córce - w momencie narodzin Orphne Junn była już niemal w pełni bogiem. Spekuluje się o wpływie chaosu, surowej magii na organizm, który nie był w stanie w żaden sposób się przed nim chronić. To jednak jedynie próby narzucenia logiki wydarzeniom, które zdają się wymykać rozumowi. Przez fakt, że Orphne była najmłodszym dzieckiem, od samego początku dla wszystkich było jasne, że nie przyjdzie jej w udziale sprawowanie władzy nad <a data-href=\"Perhyn\" href=\"places/countries/perhyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perhyn</a>. Ona sama też nigdy nie przejawiała takich zainteresowań. Wychowywała się na opowieściach o bohaterskich czynach swoich rodziców. Zawsze chciała przeżyć taką samą przygodę jak oni. Zawsze chciała uratować świat. Ćwiczyła szermierkę od momentu, gdy tylko była w stanie utrzymać miecz w ręku, posiadała również pewien talent do magii. Gdy była na tyle dorosła, by móc samemu poradzić sobie na szlaku, zaczęła podróżować, jednocześnie starając się dostać do <a data-href=\"Zakon Beithira\" href=\"others/zakon-beithira.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zakon Beithira</a>. Przemierzyła większość cywilizowanego świata wzdłuż i wszerz, walcząc z potworami, ratując ludzi i pomagając potrzebującym. Ci, którzy pamiętają Orphne z tego okresu najbardziej nie mogą nadziwić się zmianom, jakie w niej zaszły. Zapamiętali ją jako odważną, pełną pasji wojowniczkę – idealistkę, może nawet trochę naiwną, jednak przy tym wszystkim wesołą kompankę zabaw, przyjazną i uczynną. Istotę wydającą się być pozbawioną cynizmu, bezwględności i okrucieństwa. Po wielu latach w trasie, córka Renoca ostatecznie zapracowała na wstęp do Zakonu. Wybrał ją sobie na kompana młody, miedziany smok imieniem Bevrentar, również od niedawna należący do organizacji. Szkolenie Zakonne mocno zmieniło perspektywę Orphne - nauczyło ją nowego podejścia, potrzeby zrobienia wcześniejszego rozeznania, wnikliwego poznania swojego wroga. Zrozumiała, że najlepszą drogą do pokonania przeciwnika jest zrozumienie go, a przez to odnalezienie jego najsłabszych stron. Do tej pory większość walk toczyła sama - teraz pojęła korzyści płynące ze specjalizacji, zaakceptowania własnych słabości i uzupełniania ich siłą innych. Wiele lat szkoleń, wykonywania coraz bardziej wymagających misji, zdobywania doświadczenia i zaufania wśród kompanów wyniosły ją ostatecznie do Wewnętrznej Rady. Dopiero tutaj dowiedziała się o prawdziwym powodzie powstania Zakonu i zagrożeniu jakie nieustannie wisi nad tym światem. By móc lepiej przygotować się na czyhające zagrożenia, Orphne dowiedziała się wszystkiego, czego tylko mogła na temat Pierwszej Cywilizacji, Gandrów, Maegala, wojny, którą toczy Pierwsza Cywilizacja i Klątwy. Te studia nabrały dla niej szczególnego znaczenia, gdy okazało się, że jej ród toczy przekleństwo podobne w objawach do klątwy, która niegdyś dławiła jej ojczyznę. Niestety, pomimo olbrzymiej determinacji, nie udało jej się odnaleźć jej przyczyny. Pierwsza Cywilizacja stała się obsesją Orphne, obudził się w niej głód wiedzy, którego nie sposób było zaspokoić. Czuła, że ogranicza ją sposób, w jaki rozumiała magię. Nigdy nie poświęcała jej zbyt wiele czasu, teraz jednak trafiła do niej świadomość, że nie będzie w stanie wystarczająco poznać swojego przeciwnika, jeśli na pewnym poziomie nie zacznie myśleć tak jak on. Dlatego poprosiła o pomoc Nox, by ta wzięła ją na termin. Nikt nie wie co się działo przez tych 5 lat, ani gdzie Orphne podziewała się przez ten czas, ale wróciła mocno odmieniona - jakby oddalona od tego świata. Był to rok 4091. Przez kilka kolejnych lat Orphne mocno angażowała się w prace zakonu, przygotowywała ukryte twierdze, kumulowała księgi, próbowała wpłynąć na Zakon tak, by informacje na temat Pierwszej Cywilizacji były szerzej dostępne - im więcej osób miałoby świadomość o zagrożeniu, tym większa szansa, że ktoś będzie w stanie realnie wykorzystać tą wiedzę. Zaczęły jednak pojawiać się bardzo niepokojące plotki. Coś się zmieniło w Orphne. Najgorsze, że nikomu nie udało się wychwycić przyczyny tej przemiany. W Zakonie plotkowało się, że od jakiegoś czasu separuje się od ludzi, podróżuje sama, wyłącznie ze swoim smokiem, że stała się arogancka i zadufana. Jakby odkryła coś zakazanego dla pozostałych. Ludzie zaczęli mówić o dziwnych, nienaturalnych obrzędach odprawianych przez córkę Renoca. Obracała się w towarzystwie nieprzystającym jej pochodzeniu i pozycji - piratów z Kilikii, kultystów i sekciarzy. Wreszcie 9 lat temu(4106) Orphne zbezcześciła świątynie Junn w Nowym Morvannonie. Nie tylko wymordowała wszystkich kapłanów, ich ciała poświęciła w jakimś zakazanym rytuale, który otworzył bramę - nikomu nie udało się dowiedzieć dokąd prowadziła, ale wyszły z niej na ten świat dotąd nieznane stworzenia - wynaturzenia łaknące krwi mieszkańców tego świata. Orphne nie szczędziła bólu rozdając śmierć w świątyni swojej matki. Kapłanów torturowano i kaleczono. Można rzec, że jej dzieła nie powstydziłby się inkwizytor z bogatym doświadczeniem śledczym. Sama brama była czymś zupełnie nowym - nie przypominała żadnego portalu, ani teleportu jaki kiedykolwiek został otwarty w tej sferze. Towarzyszyły mu zmiany w materii świata - zapach przypominający zgniliznę, lepiące się opary, czarna, brejowata maź. Orphne po wszystkim zniknęła. W międzyczasie Zakonowi udało się zamknąć przejście, a Visceromantom dowiedzieć się czegoś o przyzwanych stworzeniach. Z pozoru przypominały demony, były jednak od nich dużo obrzydliwsze i odpychające - fizycznie i mentalnie, samą swoją formą szydzące z istot tej sfery. Założono więc, że miejsce z którego pochodzą nie jest szczególnie przyjazne. Okazało się, że aby pozostać na tym świecie potrzebują pożywienia - dusz istot zamieszkających go. Bez nich zostają wciągnięte tam skąd przybyły. Do walki z nowym zagrożeniem z pełną werwą ruszył Zakon - bo jak się okazało otwarcie pierwszego przejścia rozpoczęło kaskadę kolejnych bram, które samoistnie zaczęły się wyłaniać - nikt nie musiał ich otwierać z tej strony. Każda brama jednak delikatnie różniła się od siebie - jak i stworzenia, które z niej wychodziły. Bramy otwierają się do dzisiaj, w bardzo różnych miejscach, najczęściej w pobliżu ludzkich osad. Nikomu jeszcze nie udało się ustalić dlaczego się otwierają, co zrobiła Orphne i jak temu zaradzić. To był jednak dopiero początek. Orphne zaczęła atakować jednostki kultu Nox - nie po to by je niszczyć, tylko by okradać je z ksiąg, szczególnych ksiąg, takich o których istnieniu mało kto wiedział - pradawnych traktatów czarnoksięskich(ci, którzy je kiedykolwiek widzieli mówią, że zapisanych w językach spoza tej sfery). 3 lata temu Orphne wymordowała cały Wewnętrzny Krąg Zakonu. Wszystkich członków pojedynczo, wraz z ich rodzinami. Zakon do dzisiaj nie jest w stanie się podnieść po tym ciosie, jest rozbity i osłabiony, brakuje mu koordynacji działań. Co prawda nadal istnieje i działa - kolejne gniazda wynaturzeń są niszczone, ale nigdy nie był w tak głębokim kryzysie. Orphne przez ostatnie lata(a na pewno od zbezczeszczenia świątyni Junn) podróżuje w bardzo charakterystycznym towarzystwie, jest przy niej 5 kompanów, oraz smok, który mimo wszystkich jej grzechów nie opuścił jej. Towarzysze: - krasnoludzki wojownik, wyglądający na zaprawionego w bojach, walczy młotem, ma wygolone boki głowy z pozostawioną brązową linie włosów na środku, ponoć dostrzeżono w jego pancerzu oznaczenia Ninshuburskiej armii; - niziołek, przypominający maga, bądź druida, ponoć o bardzo wybuchowym temperamencie. Mówi się, że jego żywiołem jest woda, dostrzeżono na jego szyi kajdany, przypominające te zakładane niewolnikom; - elfia visceromantka, blada i zwiewna niczym duch, plotki mówią, że została wyrzucona ze swojej organizacji; - starszy człowiek, przypominający kupca bądź polityka - na jego szyi, niczym w marmurze wyryte są jakieś symbole, a sama skóra twarzy wydaje się pękać - mówi się, że z pęknięć wypływa jakaś ciemnofioletowa substancja; - tryton, wychudły i wydający się być bardzo osłabionym, wydaje się być wojem, zręcznie włada mieczami i krótszą bronią; Do tej pory nikomu nie udało się poznać ich imion, ani historii. Wiadomym jest, że cała kompania podróżuje od kilkunastu miesięcy po świecie. Wydają się czegoś szukać, przeglądają stare ruiny, byli już na południu Tirtalyi, w Kilikii, tam właśnie zostawili poszlaki wskazujące, że zmierzają teraz do Oklyonu - miasta w północnej części Narmerii. Orphne jest ścigana przez Zakon i wszystkie kraje północy.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["places/countries/perhyn.html","others/zakon-beithira.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"gm/historia-orphne-info-od-gm.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759494265501,"modifiedTime":1759494268587,"sourceSize":9244,"sourcePath":"gm/Historia Orphne info od GM.md","exportPath":"gm/historia-orphne-info-od-gm.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":27,"backlinks":["people/npc/orphne_team/orphne.html"],"type":"markdown"},"gm/kalendarium-świata-info-od-gm.html":{"title":"Kalendarium świata info od GM","icon":"","description":"\n3168 - Upadek <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>, cesarstwo pada pod bardzo szybko postępującą klątwą&nbsp;\n<br>3598 - Wybucha wojna na terenie dzisiejszej <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>: Lud Denehaerda (potomkowie uciekinierów z <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a> i plemiona z <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a>) wypędza królestwa Duromnii, Feniweidn, Bernicii i Demerdhre na północ, poza wyspę.&nbsp;\n3711 - Śmierć króla Torcala i wybuch wojny domowej na Półwyspie.&nbsp;\n3714 - Śmierć Maegala i zakończenie Pierwszej Kampanii&nbsp;\n<br>~3720 - Rozpoczyna się powrót ludności na zniszczone klątwą tereny dawnego <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>.&nbsp;\n3759 - Edonia - przedarcie się plemion północnych przez granice państwa&nbsp;\n3793 - Inwazja armii ogrów pod wodzą Bikuhra na Edonie - powstrzymana przez ludność Północnej Rubieży&nbsp;\n3798 - Ostateczna Ascendencja(oficjalne zakończenie Czasu Klątwy)&nbsp;\n<br>3811 - Wojna domowa w <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a>(spisek starej szlachty pod przywództwem niejakiego Bolcora - śmierć króla Dearalla - wnuka Jarrella)&nbsp;\n<br>3831 - <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> - pod wodzą Hypate próbuje odbudować <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>. <a data-href=\"Narmeria\" href=\"places/countries/narmeria.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Narmeria</a> i <a data-href=\"Kekropya info od GM\" href=\"gm/kekropya-info-od-gm.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kekropya info od GM</a> stawiają jej opór jednocześnie potwierdzając podział na 3 oddzielne państwa.&nbsp;\n<br>3932 -3942 - II Wojna domowa w <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a> - morderstwo króla Hrurbaefa(syn Bolcora) i wojna między pretendentami(Dekada 4 Władców) - zwycięża Tavuth, generał armii południowej&nbsp;\n<br>3973 - 3981 - Hegias, król <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> najeżdża <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a>.

Obecnie jest to część archipelagu powstałego w wyniku działania klątwy(niegdyś był to stały ląd połączony z ziemiami dzisiejszego <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a> i <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a>). Ze względu na swoją lokalizację Kekropya znajduje się w stałym niebezpieczeństwie ze strony agresywnego, północnego sąsiada - <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a>.

W krótkiej historii Kekropyi nie wydarzyło się nic, co mogłoby scementować poczucie potrzeby państwowości u jej obywateli. Ze względu na to, że ziemie te szczególnie dotkliwie zostały objęte klątwą, która nie dość, że zniszczyła ląd, to jeszcze wpłynęła na żyjące tu istoty, tworząc z nich dzikie bestie - dlatego ludność szukała schronienia przede wszystkim za murami miast - w sensie fizycznym i politycznym. Utworzeniu jednego przeszkadzały również warunki geograficzne - wyspy północnej części archipelagu pocięte są niezwykle trudnymi do przebycia bagniskami, bardzo często uniemożliwiając przebycie trasy między miastami drogą inną niż morska. W efekcie tego wszystkiego Kekropya stała się raczej luźnym związkiem oddzielnych miast-państw niż prawdziwym państwem. Stolica\nKekropya nie posiada formalnej stolicy. Istnieje jednak miejsce, w którym zbierają się przedstawiciele miast, by podejmować decyzje wiążące dla całego sojuszu – są to ruiny pałacu w Ogygesie. Władza<br>\nOd samego początku swojej państwowości Kekropya nie posiadała władzy centralnej. Aż do ataku ze strony <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> i próby narzucenia całemu archipelagowi swojego zwierzchnictwa, Kekropya nie była nawet traktowana jako odrębny byt polityczny. Miasta walczyły ze sobą, wchodziły w sojusze, buntowały się, spiskowały i zdradzały. W momencie, w którym pojawiło się zewnętrzne zagrożenie, które zagrażało suwerenności wszystkich miast zdecydowano się na utworzenie związku. Najważniejszą zasadą związku miast jest wieczny pokój – zakaz jakichkolwiek konfliktów zbrojnych na terenach podlegających miastom. Zapis ten dawał spore możliwości interpretacji – ale o tym później. Sojuszowi przewodzi senat - złożony z przedstawicieli wydelegowanych przez miasta. Senatorów jest równo 500 i są wymieniani co 5 lat. Liczba przedstawicieli zależy wprost proporcjonalnie od udziału wpłaconego podatku do skarbu sojuszu - im więcej miasto wpłaca pieniędzy, tym większy posiada wpływ na politykę całego państwa. Duża część miast-państw postawiła na rozwój transportu wodnego, a co dalej za tym idzie również handlu. Stało się to głównym orężem w rękach miast chcących mieć większy wpływ na losy swojego regionu. W niektórych ośrodkach doprowadziło to do sytuacji, w której to gildie kupieckie faktycznie rządzą miastem - skoro to one głównie dostarczają pieniądze na podatki, wymagane przez sojusz, to domagają się również swoich przedstawicieli w senacie. I najczęściej tak też się dzieje - przedstawiciele miast często bywają wysłannikami lokalnych gildii kupieckich. Obecnie miastem z największą ilością przedstawicieli są Bakhiady - posiadają 87 senatorów. Co istotne, jest to jedno z miast, które zamiast handlu specjalizuje się w wystawianiu mysthoforoi – wojsk najemnych. Religia<br>\nJak większość cywilizowanego świata, mieszkańcy Kekropyi oddają cześć głównemu panteonowi. Szczególne znaczenie ma jednak dla nich para bóstw - <a data-href=\"Feanor i Myrra\" href=\"people/pantheon/feanor-i-myrra.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Feanor i Myrra</a>. Wynika to z kilku powodów – przede wszystkim są to bóstwa bliskie prostemu ludowi, a tak właśnie można scharakteryzować mieszkańców ziem zniszczonych przez klątwę - uciekających ze zniszczonego cesarstwa, tułających się po całym świecie(głównymi destynacjami tego exodusu były <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a> i <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>). Po drugie, większość mieszkańców tej części archipelagu wyznaje zasadę, że nic samo na nich nie spłynie, jeśli sami się o to nie postarają, są ambitni i nie do końca wierzą w hierarchię - co bardzo pasuje do religii Feanora i Myrry. Poddani\nEkonomia miast opiera się na gildiach - to w zasadzie najistotniejsze organizacje w poszczególnych ośrodkach. To one podejmują najważniejsze decyzje dla miasta i kreują jego politykę. Każde miasto posiada coś w rodzaju własnego wewnętrznego senatu - oczywiście w różnych formach, bo każde miasto jest nieco inne. Gildie konkurują ze sobą, aby mieć jak największe wpływy w radach. Zdarzają się sytuacje, w których kupcy z różnych miast dogadują się między sobą, by wspólnie wpływać na sytuacje w regionie. Coraz częściej obserwuje się do łączenia się gildii w większe struktury, by łatwiej kontrolować obieg pieniądza. Kekropya jest również regionem, który jako pierwszy wykształcił banki. Podobnie jak gildie, Bank Miasta Thivai zwiększa swoją siłę polityczną przez sieć pożyczek i innych wysoko oprocentowanych przysług. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nCo prawda miasta sojuszu nie mogą walczyć ze sobą bezpośrednio, ale zdarzało się, że dołączały do istniejących już wojen, po stronie przeciwnej niż ich przeciwnik - by zdobyć nad nim przewagę. Zdarzyło się to dwukrotnie - podczas konfliktu między <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a> i <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a> oraz podczas napadu <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a> na <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a>. Podczas ataku Tirtalyi na osłabioną Kilikie, po stronie tej drugiej stanęło miasto Kirid, z którym Kilikia cały czas utrzymywała bardzo dobre stosunki dyplomatyczne(mieszkańcy Kiridu bardzo dobrze wspominali to, jak byli tam traktowani, gdy uciekali ze zniszczonego cesarstwa). Kirid, gdy dołączał do wojny, był sam skonfliktowany z Lasirą, która wykorzystała sytuację i opowiedziała się po stronie Tirtalyi. Jeszcze bardziej dramatyczny przebieg miał konflikt między <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a> i <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a>. Telchinis - miasto na północy, będące w bliskim sojuszu z Edonią - przyszło jej na pomoc, gdy krasnoludy wkroczyły na jej ziemie. Istankor, miasto, które od wielu lat próbowało zyskać przewagę nad Telchinisem pomogło Ninshuburowi, głównie jako zwiadowcy i informatorzy. To jednak przesądziło o losie miasta – cały archipelag oburzył się na wieść, że udzielono pomocy agresorowi o tak olbrzymiej potędze, znajdującemu się tuż przy ich granicach. Istankor został zmieciony z powierzchni ziemi. Miasto spalono, ziemie wokół posypano solą, a przedstawicieli lokalnego senatu wraz z ich rodzinami ukrzyżowano. - Największe miasta sojuszu: - Bakhiada - Thivai - Kirid - Lasira - Telchinis Plotki<br>\nMówi się, że Bakhiady obawiają się, że z czasem mogą stracić tytuł hegemona, ponoć w wewnętrznym senacie coraz częściej mówi się zacementowaniu ich przewagi przez podbój... Ponoć dyplomaci z <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a> ostatnimi czasy bardzo często schodzili ze statków w portach różnych miast Kekropyi.

Kilikia zawsze znana była z niemal przysłowiowej tolerancji i otwartości. Głównie na jej terytorium uciekali mieszkańcy zniszczonego przez klątwę cesarstwa <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>.

Wskutek tarć i wewnętrznych konfliktów, ludność coraz silniej parła na północ - co w dłuższej perspektywie doprowadziło do wielkiej wojny i exodusu północnych królestw(4 królestwa, które następnie najechały półwysep - więcej informacji w <a data-href=\"Perhyn\" href=\"places/countries/perhyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perhyn</a> i <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>), które nie były w stanie oprzeć się najeźdźcom. Te ziemie są jednak najbardziej znane z tego, że od wielu wieków mocno sprzyjają piratom. Jest to tylko częściowo prawda, ale wystarczy, aby w wyobraźni mieszkańców pozostałych krajów Kilikia rysowała się jako kraj bezprawia i braku jakiejkolwiek władzy zwierzchniej. Ulgowe traktowanie piratów wynika raczej z politycznej kalkulacji, niż jakiegokolwiek szczególnego afektem władców do korsarzy. Państwo ma spory wpływ na to kogo piraci atakują, a kogo nie, jakie transporty są chronione, a które spotykają przykre wypadki - dzięki temu można śmiało założyć, że Kilikia ma największy wpływ na to co się dzieje na morzach ze wszystkich państw. Piraci natomiast mają bezpieczną przystań, co zdecydowanie utrudnia ich wyłapanie przez pozostałe państwa. Stolica\nKorakassa Władza<br>\nKilikią już od wielu pokoleń rządzi dynastia Trachea - kuzyni <a data-href=\"Ród Mermnadów\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ród Mermnadów</a>, dynastii rządzącej niegdyś upadłym cesarstwem <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>(to właśnie dlatego uciekinierzy z cesarstwa obrali ten kierunek). Obecnym władcą jest <a data-href=\"Candales\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Candales</a>, władca, o wielkim zamiłowaniu do przygód. Był szóstym dzieckiem poprzedniego króla - Ezarda, nie mając praktycznie żadnych szans na koronę uciekł z dworu, wraz z grupą przyjaciół(również dzieci szlacheckiego pochodzenia, często w sytuacji podobnej do jego). Miał wtedy 15 lat. Przyłączył się do piratów, nauczył się żeglarstwa, słuchania rozkazów i władania kordelasem. Gdy miał 21 lat dowodził już okrętem. Gdy <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a> wypowiedziała wojnę jego ojczyźnie nie było go w domu już od siedmiu lat. Nie zdążył uratować swojej rodziny, ale zdążył stawić taki opór wojskom przeciwnika, że porzuciły one myśl o wchłonięciu całego kraju. Niestety Kilikia przegrała tą wojnę. Nie utraciła swojej państwowości, ale pozostaje pod faktyczną zwierzchnością <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>, która sprawuje władzę za pośrednictwem królewskiego doradcy - <a data-href=\"Cadfal\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cadfal</a> Religia<br>\nMieszkańcy Kilikii nigdy do końca nie przekonali się do bogów głównego panteonu - i to prawdopodobnie jedyna rzecz, która łączy ich z <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>. Władza nigdy szczególnie nie ingerowała w wierzenia poddanych, nigdy też nie zaistniał standardowy mariaż tronu z ołtarzem. Z tego też względu w Kilikii czci się bardzo szeroki wachlarz bóstw - od głównego panteonu, po bóstwa Niemych Wydm. Nic nie stoi również na przeszkodzie, by poszczególne religie interpretować tu według własnych wizji, np. poprzez oddawanie czci tylko jednemu aspektowi konkretnego bóstwa. Z tych względów jest to idealne miejsce na szerzenie się najróżniejszych kościołów, kultów i kompletnie nowych religii. Mówi się, że jeśli gdziekolwiek jeszcze przetrwali wyznawcy Starych Bóstw, to właśnie tu – w Kilikii. Poddani<br>\nPod względem demograficznym państwo Kilikii jest silnie zróżnicowane. Trzonem społeczeństwa są potomkowie plemion ludzi, mieszkających tu od niepamiętnych czasów. Jak żaden inny lud zamieszkujący te ziemie, wierzą w wolność – a narzucona im podległość jątrzy się w nich niczym najgorsza rana. Kolejną, bardzo liczną grupą, są potomkowie uciekinierów z cesarstwa <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a> - ci, którzy czy to z powodów politycznych, czy osobistych, nie powrócili do ojczyzny, gdy klątwa opuściła ich ziemie. Ta grupa pod względem rasowym jest niezwykle zróżnicowana. Wydawałoby się jednak, że prym wiodą tu niziołki i elfowie. Mówi się, że niziołkom zasmakowało życie w Kilikii i nie chcą znów ruszać w podróż, by po raz kolejny od nowa budować całe społeczeństwo. Elfowie natomiast - jeśli uda się od nich cokolwiek wyciągnąć - mówią, że nie byliby w stanie patrzeć na to, co zostało z cesarstwa - wolą pielęgnować w swoich sercach wspomnienia tych miejsc, gdy było w pełni chwały. Reszta społeczeństwa Kilikii przypomina otaczające ją morza - jest płynna i w ciągłym ruchu. Wiele osób przybywa tu ze względu na wolność religijną, inni przypływają pod pirackimi flagami, jeszcze inni uciekają spod tyranii <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>. Tworzy to ogromny miszmasz różnych ras, kultur i religii, czyniąc z Kilikii prawdziwy tygiel narodów. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nKilikia w ostatnich latach nie sprzyjało szczęście. Ogromny exodus ludności, która przybyła tu po upadku cesarstwa, nie obył się bez reperkusji. Potwierdziły to kolejne konflikty. Po klęsce zadanej przez <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> państwo nigdy nie odzyskało dawnej siły militarnej. <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a> wykorzystała to sprawnie, bardzo szybko podporządkowując sobie Kilikiię. Z każdym kolejnym rokiem <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a> zwiększa obciążenia nałożone na wyspy. Jedni mówią, że chcą w ten sposób wzbogacić się na podbitym kraju, inni twierdzą, że spychają słabe państwo pod ścianę, by w końcu samo eksplodowało, co dałoby możliwość na pełen podbój, zachowując czyste ręce. Słabość rządów państwa próbują wykorzystać piraci. <a data-href=\"Liga Czarnych Żagli\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Liga Czarnych Żagli</a> chętnie pomogłaby wyswobodzić się Kilikii z więzów paddaństwa w zamian za większy wpływ na kierunek, w jakim zmierza państwo.

Od kilku lat wśród kast rozwija się również wiara w <a data-href=\"Władcy Wód\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Władcy Wód</a> – grupę bóstw, które rzekomo przemawiają do ludzi z morskich głębin.

Poddani<br>\nW Ligurgii niezwykle ważne jest zaszeregowanie do rodzin i klanów. To klan pełni nadrzędną rolę – może skupiać od kilku do nawet kilkudziesięciu rodzin. Rodziny wewnątrz klanów często walczą ze sobą o przywództwo. O ile przynależność do rodziny opiera się na więzach krwi, o tyle do klanu nie obowiązują już takie ograniczenia - nawet nie spokrewnione ze sobą rodziny mogą do niego przynależeć, a co równie istotne - nawet rodziny różnych ras mogą współistnieć w jednym klanie. Klany zapewniają członkom ochronę – są zobowiązane bronić każdej rodziny i każdego jej członka. Ważniejsze jest jednak kumulowanie siły politycznej - najpotężniejsze klany utrzymują kilkutysięczne armie i rozległe posiadłości; z tymi największymi muszą liczyć się nawet królowie(klany królów nie są największe, ani najpotężniejsze). Klany mają prawo przyjmować do siebie dowolne rodziny, jak i je wyrzucać. Ludność Ligurgii dzieli się na 3 kasty: - szlachtę - najmniej liczna grupa, składająca się z potomków rodzin szlacheckich z czasów cesarstwa. Całość władzy w państwie należy do nich, a także większość bogactwa. - wolnych - mieszkańcy miast, rolnicy, kupcy, zwykli żołnierze. Prawo ich chroni. Przez to, że szlachty jest coraz mniej, wolni od niedawna mają możliwość dostąpić szlachectwa - głównie na 2 sposoby: przez wkupienie się(całego swojego klanu), bądź adopcje przez kogoś z rodzin szlacheckich. Wolni dzielą się na 2 grupy: potomków rodzin z Ephyrei i rodzin, które przybyły tu w okresie powrotu, lub już po. - niewolników - najliczniejsza grupa w całym państwie. W większości są to potomkowie ludów, które próbowały przejąć te ziemie przed powrotem potomków z Ephyrei. Znaczący rozrost tej grupy nastąpił również po wojnie Ligurgii z <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a>. Poza tym za najcięższe przewiny sądy mogą skazać obywatela – nawet wolnego czy, w wyjątkowych przypadkach, szlachcica – na utratę wolności i statusu. Niewolnicy są wykorzystywani do wszystkich ciężkich prac w państwie, jako służba klanów szlacheckich itp. Właściciel niewolnika może zrobić z nim co chce, są traktowani praktycznie jak część wyposażenia domostwa. Co jakiś czas wybuchają bunty niewolników, które władza tłumi przykładowo – i krwawo. To wśród tej grupy jest najwięcej kultystów <a data-href=\"Władcy Wód\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Władcy Wód</a>. Pod względem rasowym społeczeństwo Ligurgii składa się głównie z elfów, ludzi i gnomów. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nLigurczycy to bez wątpienia lud wojowniczy – trudy wojny nie budzą w nich strachu. Zaraz po powrocie na rodzinne ziemie zamierzali podporządkować sobie cały archipelag dawnego cesarstwa. Nie spodziewali się jednak, że natrafią na tak silny opór. Postanowili więc przeczekać kilka lat, odbudować się i zgromadzić nowe siły. W tym czasie pozostałe państwa archipelagu miały baczenie na ruchy Ligurgii, dlatego skierowali ostrze w inną stronę - ku wyspom <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a>. Oficjalną przyczyną wybuchu wojny była polityka <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a> względem piratów. Władze tego kraju miały z piratami podpisane umowy, które pozwalały im zimować na ich wybrzeżach, bez strachu przed prześladowaniami, w zamian za niewielką opłatę - i co ważniejsze możliwość skierowania piratów na konkretne cele. Ten dziwny sojusz był wygodny dla obu stron. Piraci mocno dali się we znaki powracającym Ligurczykom; ci nigdy im tego nie zapomnieli. Najważniejszy był jednak honor: potrzebowali zwycięskiej wojny, by zmazać klęskę poniesioną na archipelagu. Ligurgia zwyciężyła wojnę, zdobyła ogromne bogactwa i rzeszę niewolników. Wśród rozmów coraz częściej pojawiał się temat powtórnej próby zdobycia ziem <a data-href=\"Kekropya\" href=\"places/countries/kekropya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kekropya</a> i <a data-href=\"Narmeria\" href=\"places/countries/narmeria.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Narmeria</a>. Ich plany zostały jednak poplątane przez ich własne zwycięstwo. Niewolnicy z <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a> nie byli przyuczeni do posłuchu. Wojna mocno nadszarpnęła liczebność wojsk, jednocześnie drastycznie zwiększając liczbę niewolników. Państwo pogrążyło się w długotrwałych, krwawych buntach, silnie paraliżujących Ligurgie na wiele lat. Plotka głosi, że <a data-href=\"Kekropya\" href=\"places/countries/kekropya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kekropya</a> i <a data-href=\"Narmeria\" href=\"places/countries/narmeria.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Narmeria</a> po cichu wspierały armie zbuntowanych niewolników, by osłabić Ligurgię. Zaraz po tym nastąpiły dwa kolejne wydarzenia, które uniemożliwiły powrót do rozważań nad ewentualną wojną z sąsiadami: - agresja <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a> na <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a> oraz zawarcie sojuszu obronnego przeciw ewentualnemu atakowi z północy; - lokalna wojna z mieszkańcami byłej stolicy cesarstwa - jak się bowiem okazało po zbudowaniu Pyrrhonu(umiejscowionego przy brzegu morza, które zalało starą stolicę), w ruinach dawnej stolicy zalęgły się tajemnicze morskie stwory. Stworom nie podobało się, że nad ich głowami powstało ogromne miasto z wielkim portem - rozpoczęły więc atakować statki i nadmorskie posiadłości. Skala zagrożenia zmusiła władze do przeniesienia portu daleko od Pyrrhonu; armia stale okupuje wybrzeże, odpierając kolejne ataki.

Niegdyś część cesarstwa <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>. Obecnie w sojuszu obronnym z <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> i <a data-href=\"Kekropya\" href=\"places/countries/kekropya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kekropya</a>. Sojusz jest przede wszystkim wymierzony w agresywne państwo krasnoludów - <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a>. Stolica\nIkelos Władza<br>\nNarmeria jest państwem teokratycznym. Kapłani <a data-href=\"Trastigos\" href=\"people/pantheon/trastigos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Trastigos</a> wykazali się zmysłem politycznym w momencie zniszczenia klątwy i ascendencji bohatera – od razu rozpoczęli kampanię, której celem było przekonanie mas, że cofnięcie kataklizmu i uwolnienie ziem cesarstwa było zasługą ich bóstwa. Mówi się, że idea na tą propagandę wyszła od samego Trastigosa. Tak czy inaczej kapłani zbierali wokół siebie coraz większą ilość osób powracających na zniszczony wyspy. Powrót dla wielu rodów, często po wielopokoleniowej tułaczce, było doświadczeniem wręcz duchowym. Właśnie na to liczyli duchowni. Kapłani nie próżnowali przez cały ten czas - starali się wszystkim zarządzać, tak aby cały czas być w centrum wydarzeń. Ten wysiłek się opłacił. Dla wielu stało się naturalnym to, że kapłani decydują - skoro to ich bóstwo wywalczyło dla ludu te ziemie. Na czele państwa stoi Arcykapłan Trastigosa. Jest on wybierany przez radę kolegialną kościoła Trastigosa, wraz z przedstawicielami Starej Szlachty - najważniejszych rodów, których korzenie sięgały <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>. Arcykapłan jest wybierany z duchownych, którzy już urodzili się w Narmerii. Chciano w ten sposób zmniejszyć szansę na zewnętrzną ingerencję – szczególnie ze strony <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> i <a data-href=\"Kekropya\" href=\"places/countries/kekropya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kekropya</a>. Obecnym Arcykapłanem jest niziołek - <a data-href=\"Folvah\" href=\"people/npc/oklyon_npc/folvah.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Folvah</a>. Jego rządy cechują stonowane decyzje oraz zachowawcza i ostrożna polityka zagraniczna. Głównie przez te cechy wybrano go na przywódcę już ponad 70 lat temu, gdy państwo potrzebowało spokoju, by móc całość swoich sił skierować na odbudowę. Folvah ma 163 lata - wiek nawet dla niziołków zaawansowany. Jego coraz gorsze samopoczucie budzi dysputy w jakim kierunku powinien ponieść Narmerie jego następca. Religia<br>\nGłówną religią państwa jest oczywiście wiara w Główny Panteon, a przede wszystkim w Trastigosa. Jednak również inne religie mają silne wpływy w Narmerii. Szczególnie kult <a data-href=\"Horkos\" href=\"people/pantheon/horkos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Horkos</a>, którego obecność na tych ziemiach sięga czasów <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>. Poddani<br>\nWiększość Narmeryjczyków stanowią ludzie, niziołki i krasnoludy. Wielu z nich wróciło na wyspy zaraz po zniszczeniu klątwy, jednak niektóre rody do dziś spływają na swoją ojczyznę. Największym bogactwem wysp oraz głównym źródłem ich majątku są kopalnie złota, położone w górach na zachód od Ikelosu. Złoto pozwoliło na stosunkowo szybką odbudowę gospodarki państwa. Obecnie wykorzystywane jest do wzmacniania obronności wysp – głównie przez inwestycje w stocznie i statki. Tak jak pozostałe części upadłej <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a> - Narmeria jest pocięta ruinami dawnej potęgi. To właśnie na tych ruinach wyrastały obecne największe miasta regionu. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nPowrót na te ziemie rozpoczął się tuż po zakończeniu <a data-href=\"Czas Klątwy\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Czas Klątwy</a>. Ludzie wracali na ziemie, z których pochodzili ich pradziadowie. Początkowo wydawało się, że wszystko będzie zmierzało do przywrócenia <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a> na mapy - wyspy powoli się zapełniały, nie było żadnej władzy zwierzchniej, ośrodki organizowały się samoistnie. Aż do momentu, gdy wojowniczy władcy <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> zapragnęli przejąć władzę nad resztą archipelagu. Doprowadziło to do wojny, w której razem z miastami <a data-href=\"Kekropya\" href=\"places/countries/kekropya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kekropya</a> udało się powstrzymać zakusy agresora. Był to również moment ostatecznej konsolidacji 3 państw w odrębne twory polityczne. Ze względu na agresywny i ciągle rosnący w siłę <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a> oraz ambitną <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>, Narmeria podpisała defensywny sojusz z <a data-href=\"Ligurgia\" href=\"places/countries/ligurgia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ligurgia</a> i <a data-href=\"Kekropya\" href=\"places/countries/kekropya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kekropya</a> - w razie ataku na jeden z tych 3 krajów pozostałe 2 są zobowiązane do udzielenia niezwłocznej pomocy militarnej.

Przez długi czas państwo pozostawało pokojowo nastawione – bardziej z powodu swojego potencjału militarno-gospodarczego niż pobudek moralnych.

Władza przechodzi zawsze na najstarsze dziecko, niezależnie czy jest to syn, czy córka. Jeśli władcą jest kobieta to jej małżeństwo ma charakter matrilinearny(dzieci ze związku włączane są do rodu kobiety). Władca posiada swoją radę, której zadaniem jest – oczywiście – doradzać mu oraz wprowadzać jego decyzje w życie. W skład rady wchodzi 5 osób: - Obrońca Ogniska - najwyższy kapłan - Dowódca armii królewskich(któremu zazwyczaj towarzyszą 3 generałowie) - Wielki Skarbnik - Wielki Bachmistrz - Następca tronu Każdy z członków rady posiada swoją świtę. Religia<br>\nMieszkańcy Ninshuburu znają główny panteon, ale nie darzą go wielkim zaufaniem. Od wielu pokoleń krasnoludy czczą personifikację żywiołu ognia – <a data-href=\"Idhayil\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Idhayil</a>. Idhayil to bóstwo wszystkiego co łączone jest z ogniem - od ogniska, które rozświetla mroki nocy, przez kuchnie podgrzewające strawe, latarnie morskie prowadzące żeglarzy, piece kowalskie, aż po uczucie rozchodzącego się ciepła po wypiciu gorzałki. Krasnoludy czczą każdy możliwy aspekt tego bóstwa. Nie ma praw zakazujących wiary w innych bogów ani nakazujących czcić tylko jednego. Osoby obnoszące się ze swoim innowierstwem są jednak mocno marginalizowane społecznie. Poddani\nNinshubur rozwijał swoją państwowość w cieniu dwóch sił kształtujących jego kulturę: wulkanu Aazo i ogromnej pustyni zwanej Niemymi Wydmami. Stepy okalające pustynię przepełnione są bandami konnych grasantów i rabusiów. Społeczeństwo od początków osadnictwa budowało wysokie wieże, by dostrzec zagrożenie z wyprzedzeniem. Stało się to częścią kultury Ninshubur - miast solidnych fortec władcy tej krainy budują olbrzymie, okrągłe wieże. Poddanymi Ninshuburu do niedawna były niemal wyłącznie krasnoludy – aż do najazdu na Edonię. Obecnie krasnale nie stanowią nawet połowy ludności swojego państwa. Prowadzi to do wielu nieprzyjemności, a 'edońska' część kraju jest niemal cały czas na skraju buntu. Tempo rozrostu kraju wyprzedziło rozwiązania administracyjne, więc niektóre regiony zmuszone są do samoregulacji – panuje tam prawo przypominające dziki zachód. Zapewne nadal istnieją tam wsie, do których nie dotarła jeszcze zmiana władzy. Ninshubur do dzisiaj boryka się z okiełznaniem tej krainy. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nZaledwie 150 lat temu Ninshubur był niewielkim państwem granicznym, zajmującym się głównie wydobyciem metali i handlem. Swoją suwerenność zawdzięczali istnieniu na krańcu cywilizowanego świata i wrodzony talent do tworzenia defensywnych zabudowań. Coś się jednak zmieniło. Plotka głosi, że krasnoludy odnalazły coś głęboko w kopalniach u podnóża wulkanu – tajemnicze ‘Serce Aazo’. Niewielu zna jego prawdziwą naturę. Zaraz po odkryciu kopalnię zamknięto i przekształcono w ogromną twierdzę Yas’Angad – Dom Zgliszczy. Powołano też specjalną formację wojskową, mającą wyłącznie chronić tę twierdzę. Żołnierze z tej formacji nie mają prawa opuszczać twierdzy do końca życia. Plotka głosi, że wszyscy świadkowie odkrycia Serca zostali zgładzeni – tę historię rozgłaszają przede wszystkim kraje sąsiednie. Tak czy inaczej od tego momentu rozpoczął się szybki rozwój państwa. Nowe twierdze wyrastały przy granicy z Edonią niczym grzyby po deszczu, a kolejne stocznie oblepiały krótką linię brzegową Ninshuburu. Aż nastał rok 4081 i 3 armie pod komendą <a data-href=\"Ibbisin\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ibbisin</a> przekroczyły granicę Edonii. Kampania była trudna, a cel ambitny - zająć całą południową część państwa. Ninshubur jednak miał kilka przewag w tej potyczce - nikt nie spodziewał się ich ataku, swoją potęgę państwo ukrywało bardzo skrupulatnie. Edonia, jak w sumie zawsze, miała wewnętrzne problemy. Dodatkowo agresor dysponował tajną bronią – oddziałami olbrzymich Lerritanów. Do tego ogrom różnego rodzaju golemów, od stalowych po adamantynowe. W bardzo różnych rozmiarach i formach - część z nich była wielkości ninshuburskich wież, inne mniejsze od ludzkich dzieci. Zaskakująca była nie tylko wielkość i różnorodność tych sił, ale przede wszystkim ich inteligencja i spryt. Edończycy mieli wręcz wrażenie, jakby walczyli z żywymi ludźmi. Armie <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a>, <a data-href=\"Perhyn\" href=\"places/countries/perhyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perhyn</a> i <a data-href=\"Yanthalei\" href=\"places/countries/yanthalei.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yanthalei</a> mimo waleczności i poświęceniu nie były w stanie oprzeć się najeźdźcy. Przez pewien czas udawało im się co najwyżej spowalniać przemarsz wojsk. Kiedy było pewne, że żadne z tych państw nie ma sił potrafiących oprzeć się siłom krasnoludów zdecydowano poddać się - by nie mnożyć i tak ogromnych strat. Ninshubur głęboko upokorzył Edonię, przejmując jej ogromną część ziem. To nie tylko zwycięstwo militarne, to przede wszystkim prawdziwy debiut polityczny Ninshubur. Wojna wyłoniła hegemona cywilizowanego świata. Plotki\nWiele mówi się o tym, że pokonanie Edonii mogło być wyłącznie przedsmakiem tego, co Ninshubur może zgotować pozostałym krajom. Plotkuje się o tym, że niektórzy władcy chcieliby przeprowadzić prowizoryczne uderzenie, zanim Ninshubur rozwiąże swoje wewnętrzne problemy i będzie gotowe na kolejny podbój. Pytanie, kto te plotki rozsiewa?

Wszystko zaczęło się od wojny domowej, rozpoczętej wraz ze śmiercią ostatniego króla - Torcala. Najistotniejszą frakcją walczącą w tym konflikcie, z punktu widzenia utworzenia Perhynu byli autochtoni - lud, który został niegdyś podbity przez 4 królestwa uciekające z południa. Autochtoni przyjęli do siebie przyjaciół z wymiaru bardzo bliskiego światu w którym żyli - feyów, ich rodzimy świat został niemal kompletnie zniszczony przez klątwę. Feyowie, pod władzą Maegala, wsparli swoich pobratymców. Pomimo śmierci przywódcy to właśnie ta frakcja zwyciężyła, niemal kompletnie anihilując buntowników odpowiedzialnych za śmierć Torcala i rozpętanie konfliktu. Trzecia frakcja - Rojaliści - opuściła Półwysep i wyruszyła na południe, by założyć <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>. Władzę w nowo powstałym państwie przejął <a data-href=\"Renoc\" href=\"people/renoc.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Renoc</a> - zaufany Maegala, i jak się okazało jeden z potomków królewskiego rodu feyów. Jego wybranką została <a data-href=\"Junn\" href=\"people/pantheon/junn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Junn</a> - bohaterka, która wraz z kompanami zakończyła Czas Klątwy, wyswobodziła stare bóstwa z niewoli i ocaliła ten świat. By móc nadal kontynuować swoje dzieło, wraz z drużyną dostąpiła ascendencji. Od samego początku swojej państwowości Perhyn jest w sojuszu z dwoma państwami: - <a data-href=\"Yanthalei\" href=\"places/countries/yanthalei.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yanthalei</a> - sojusz był opłacalny dla obydwu stron - państwo trytonów od wielu lat robiło wszystko, by móc na powrót mieć jakieś znaczenie na świecie. Perhyn w początkowym okresie swojego władztwa nie najlepiej sobie radził z przejmowaniem terytoriów - było bardzo dużo lokalnych walk i niezadowolonych wielmożów. Z tego względu oddano jedną z prowincji, w zamian za pomoc i wiekuisty sojusz. Obydwa kraje były zadowolone z tego rozwiązania. - <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a> - ten kraj był w kompletnym rozpadzie, po klątwie, zniszczeniu Visceromantów i przebudzeniu Vanrila nic nie chroniło pozostałych edończyków przed napadami sąsiadów. Renoc wysłał część swoich sił, by ustabilizować te ziemie i wnieść na tron przyjaznych mu ludzi. Na jakiś czas to podziałało, jednak upadek Edonii był zbyt głęboki, by móc ją podnieść jednym, prostym gestem. Kolejni władcy się zmieniali, jednak sojusz był odnawiany - polityka czasów po klątwie była zbyt niestabilna, by łatwo rezygnować z sojuszów. Stolica\nArellya Władza<br>\nCentralna władza Perhynu ma ściśle zhierarchizowaną strukturę. Na czele stoi oczywiście król, bezpośrednio pod nim jest 4 Arcyksiążąt, każdy odpowiedzialny za oddzielną wielką prowincje Perhynu, pod każdym arcyksięciem działają książęta (zarządzający księstwami), a pod nimi hrabiowie (zarządzający hrabstwami). Co bardzo istotne, w Perhynie działa zasada \"wasal mego wasala nie jest moim wasalem\", czyli każdy odpowiada wyłącznie przed swoim bezpośrednim seniorem, zgodnie z czym król nie jest w stanie wydawać bezpośrednich rozkazów hrabiom. Zasada ta została ukuta w ogniu odbudowy państwa po wojnie domowej, celem rozdzielania odpowiedzialności za ustabilizowane części kraju, tak aby sam władca mógł skupić się zaprowadzaniu porządku w miejscach o które trzeba było nadal walczyć. Renoc i <a data-href=\"Junn\" href=\"people/pantheon/junn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Junn</a> posiadali 3 dzieci: Thiose, <a data-href=\"Faelan\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Faelan</a> i <a data-href=\"Orphne\" href=\"people/npc/orphne_team/orphne.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Orphne</a>. Thiose niestety zmarła w skutek bardzo dziwnej choroby, niespełna 100 lat temu. Choroba bardzo przypominała objawy Klątwy, lecz nie przenosiła się na innych. Niedługo potem ten sam los spotkał Renoca. Niestety w żaden sposób nie udało się go uratować. Od tego czasu państwem rządzi <a data-href=\"Faelan\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Faelan</a>. Parę miesięcy temu u niego również zaczęły występować objawy. Religia<br>\nZ oczywistych względów najważniejszym bóstwem w kraju jest <a data-href=\"Junn\" href=\"people/pantheon/junn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Junn</a>. Nie oznacza to, że pozostałe bóstwa panteonu są pominięte, ród Renoca nie zapomniał dzięki komu posiada władzę w kraju. Kościoły oddają cześć całemu panteonowi, cały kraj wznosi do nich swoje modły. Perhyn jest jedynym krajem, gdzie kościoły panteonu współpracują w ramach jednej organizacji - <a data-href=\"Konsylium\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Konsylium</a>. Przedstawiciele bóstw, które brały udział w pokonaniu klątwy i <a data-href=\"Horkos\" href=\"people/pantheon/horkos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Horkos</a>, wspólnie decydują o polityce kościołów i kultów, tak by nie wchodzić sobie w drogę i aby mieć możliwość obierania wspólnego stanowiska w obliczu niebezpieczeństwa z zewnątrz. Za takie niebezpieczeństwo jest uznana np wiara w Starych Bogów. Polityka wszystkich kościołów jest w tej kwestii jednolita - religia za którą kryła się <a data-href=\"Pierwsza Cywilizacja\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pierwsza Cywilizacja</a>, powinna zostać wyeradykowana, przy użyciu wszelkich dostępnych środków. Niestety nawet dzisiaj nadal istnieją czciciele tej zakazanej religii, dlatego też <a data-href=\"Konsylium\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Konsylium</a> powołało organizacje będącą jego zbrojnym ramieniem, wymierzonym w zaprzańców i heretyków - <a data-href=\"Zakon Horkosa\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zakon Horkosa</a>, jako, że jest to bóstwo praw i pierwszy w panteonie. Poddani<br>\nSpołeczeństwo Perhynu jest niezwykle skomplikowanym zagadnieniem. Zaczynając od tego, że ziemie te niegdyś zostały podbite przez kompletnie obce ludy(4 królestwa z południa), które z oczywistych względów musiały represjonować podbitych autochtonów. Sami agresorzy nie byli monolitem, wywodzili się z państw, które przez większość swoich dziejów walczyli między sobą. Z tego kotła musiało w końcu wykipić, czego realnym obrazem była wojna domowa. Na to wszystko należy nałożyć jeszcze przybycie feyów i przejęcie władzy w całym kraju przez jednego z nich. Nie mówiąc już nawet o nagłym zwrocie w kwestii religii - usunięciu dawnych bóstw, do których ludzie byli przyzwyczajeni i zastąpienie ich kompletnie nowymi. Echa tych wszystkich wydarzeń są widoczne nawet dzisiaj. Nie wszystkim pasują rządy najeźdźcy - od momentu powstania Perhynu ród Renoca mierzył się z ponad 20 większymi buntami. Prowincje próbowały się oddzielać, opłacani korsarze plądrowali brzegi, agenci obcych państw(żadnym zaskoczeniem nie będzie fakt, że niemal wyłącznie odpowiadała za to <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a>, ale również <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a>), przez różnego rodzaju spiski próbowali skłócić Perhyn z sojusznikami, nie mówiąc już nawet o wielokrotnych próbach zamachu na życia Renoca i jego rodu. Wszystko to napędza tylko różnego rodzaju napięcia - nie tylko między rasami, ale też na punkcie religijnym, czy politycznym. Zaścianek Perhynu, wszystkie małe miasteczka i zapomniane przez bogów wioski, to w zasadzie oddzielne, zamknięte światy. Ksenofobia i samosądy to niechlubne znaki rozpoznawcze tego regionu. Władanie tak skomplikowanym tworem nie jest proste. Szepcze się o tym, że ród Renoca posiada na swoje rozkazy tajną policje, przygotowaną i przeszkoloną przez kościół <a data-href=\"Feanor i Myrra\" href=\"people/pantheon/feanor-i-myrra.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Feanor i Myrra</a>. Są to jednak wyłącznie plotki. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nOstatnie lata nie były łatwe dla państwa - wzmocnienie <a data-href=\"Tirtalya\" href=\"places/countries/tirtalya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tirtalya</a> kładzie się cieniem na planach polityków, klęska w obronie <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a> przed <a data-href=\"Ninshubur\" href=\"places/countries/ninshubur.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ninshubur</a>, nie przyniosło chwały, a wręcz uwypukliło słabość sojuszników. Tajemnicza choroba trawiąca ród Renoca nie przydaje władającym tymi ziemiami popularności - wspomina się boskim gniewie, odwróceniu się panteonu państwa. A wszystko to w tle chaosu, który wydaje się panować wszędzie poza głównymi ośrodkami. Coraz częściej wspomina się, że jeśli Perhyn sam nie ustabilizuje swoich sytuacji, to zrobi to ktoś z zewnątrz.

Niegdyś to państwo było podzielone na 4 oddzielne królestwa, które zajmowały północną część wyspy. Królestwa były w stanie ciągłej wojny, z krótkimi okresami pokoju, aby złapać trochę powietrza. Były tak pochłonięte wzajemnymi waśniami, że przeoczyły niebezpieczeństwo z południa – plemiona barbarzyńców i uciekinierów ze zniszczonego cesarstwa <a data-href=\"Ephyrea\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ephyrea</a>. Ludy wypędzone klątwą z południa. Królestwa nie były gotowe na starcie z taką nawałą. Po kilku dotkliwych klęskach i kolejnych walkach pomiędzy sobą postanowiono uciec na północ - na Półwysep, sojusznicze ziemie. Po tym jak Królestwa zorientowały się, że Półwysep nie ma pełnej państwowości, a raczej jest luźnym związkiem plemion, do tego nie mającym zbyt wielkiego znaczenia militarnego to postanowiono podbić te ziemie, miast walczyć z hordą na południu. Wojna została wygrana, a 4 królestwa stopiły się w jedno. Po 100 latach wybuchła wojna domowa, klątwa została zniszczona, Maegala zabito, nowe bóstwa zapełniły wakaty w panteonie. Feyowie - najeźdźcy z obcego planu podbiły Półwysep. Rojaliści, ostatni bastion pamięci o 4 Królestwach został zmuszony do powrotu na rodzinne ziemie - na wyspę. Walki o odbicie ziem trwały ponad 50 lat. Frakcja Rojalistów w wyniku tych wszystkich wydarzeń poczuła się zdradzona. Odebrano im ziemie, którą sobie wywalczyli, zamordowano ich króla, a osoby, które w tym wszystkim uczestniczyły(bardzo aktywnie) wyniesiono do Panteonu. Dlatego też nie ma większych wrogów Feyów i bóstw obecnego Panteonu niż Stara Szlachta Tirtalyi. Stolica\nRoghbarraigh Władza<br>\nObecnie Tirtalya sprawuje władzę nad całą wyspą. U steru władzy pozostaje ród Torcala – ostatniego króla Półwyspu (linia wywodzi się od jego wuja, Anwasa). Obecnym władcą jest bardzo młody <a data-href=\"Berian mab Islwyn\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Berian mab Islwyn</a>. Król posiada władzę absolutną. Bezpieczeństwo władcy zapewnie Straż Przyboczna, będąca jednocześnie Radą Państwa. Jest to bardzo elitarna jednostka. Liczba Strażników jest stała i zawsze równa ilości hrabstw w państwie - obecnie jest ich 37. Każde hrabstwo ma obowiązek wystawić jednego Strażnika. Wymagania względem takiego osobnika są bardzo wysokie, poza oczywistościami jak np wiek(25-60 lat) i rasa(wyłącznie ludzie), musi należeć do Starej Szlachty Tirtalyi - czyli jego przodkowie musieli odbić te ziemie z rąk barbarzyńców, oraz musi przejść szereg egzaminów testujących jego sprawność fizyczną, etykietę, wiedzę na temat polityki i historii. Dodatkowo egzaminy są powtarzane co 3 lata dla każdego Strażnika, tak, aby władca miał cały czas przy sobie osoby kompetentne, będące w stanie zapewnić mu bezpieczeństwo, ale także wykonać różne specjalne misje. Osoby, które odchodzą ze Strażników najczęściej nadal uczestniczą w życiu politycznym Tirtalyi, jako ambasadorowie, władcy ziemscy, generałowie, czy jak <a data-href=\"Cadfal\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cadfal</a> - specjalni doradcy w obcych państwach. Religia\nPod względem religii Tirtalya mocno odstaje od pozostałych państw. Jest to jedyny kraj w którym obowiązuje oficjalny zakaz czczegnia obecnego panteonu. Zakaz jest traktowany bardzo surowo. Osoby otwarcie modlące się do głównego panteonu mogą zostać spalone na stosie – pod warunkiem, że odmówią publicznego wyrzeczenia się tej wiary. Mieszkańcy Tirtalyi uważają, że zostali oszukani przez bohaterów, którzy dokonali ascendencji, dlatego też wierzą w Stare Bóstwa(tak obecnie nazywane są bóstwa, które pochodzą z Pierwszej Cywilizacji), modlą się o ich wskrzeszenie i powrót do tego świata. Ze względu na to, że Stare Bóstwa nie odpowiadają na modlitwy to większość ludzi modli się do pomniejszych bogów, zajmujących się codziennymi sprawami. Poddani\nSpołeczeństwo Tirtalyi dzieli się w zasadzie na 3 grupy: Starą Szlachtę, czyli potomków ludów, które odbiły te ziemie;\nNową Szlachtę, czyli wszyscy, którzy zdobyli szlachectwo przez ostatnie ~400 lat Lud, czyli pozostali: rolnicy, mieszczanie, kupcy i przedstawiciele wolnych zawodów, przede wszystkim potomkowie podbitych plemion\nFakt miażdżącej przewagi liczebnej ludu wymusił na szlachetnie urodzonych spore ustępstwa, przez co ci pierwsi mają wyjątkowo duże swobody. Podatki nie przygniatają najbiedniejszych, nie ma niewolnictwa, sędziowie wybierani są wśród mieszkańców danego ośrodka, brak jest przywiązania człowieka do ziemi itd. Z tego też względu rozpoczęto proces wzmacniania stanu szlachetnego, przez nadawania nobilitacji najbardziej zasłużonym(tj lojalnym i bogatym). Jeśli chodzi o podejście do ras, to państwo jest raczej otwarte, z niewielkim wyjątkiem odnośnie feyów, których nienawidzą i których mieszkańcy całej wyspy mają prawo bez sądu mordować, jeśli nawet stopą naruszą granicę Tirtalyi. Państwo nie przepada również za elfami(przez bliskość z feyami), ale jest to raczej niechęć niż nienawiść, wyspę zamieszkuje kilka elfich rodów. Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nPo tym jak 4 Królestwa zostały zepchnięte z wyspy, ludy, które do tego doprowadziły poszły w rozsypkę. Łączył ich tylko jeden cel - usunąć niebezpieczeństwo zagrażające im od północy, poza tą jedną rzeczą był to zlepek najróżniejszych plemion z całego południa. Zaraz po zwycięstwa cała koalicja rozpadła się na dziesiątki niewielkich plemion, czasami o zasięgu kilku wiosek. Te miniaturowe ośrodki konkurowały ze sobą, ale do momentu powrotu Rojalistów na te ziemie nie znalazł się nikt, kto byłby w stanie ponownie zjednoczyć tą ludność. To był właśnie klucz do sukcesu Rojalistów na wyspie - część plemion podbijali, część godziła się przejść pod ich kuratele, w zamian za opłacanie podatków otrzymywali ochronę i porządek. Państwo w pewnym momencie zawładnęło całą wyspą - to była dla niego najtrudniejsza chwila, oznaczało to bowiem, że zostanie dostrzeżone na arenie międzynarodowej, szczęśliwie większość państw nadal leczyło rano po Czasie Klątwy i nawet gdyby kogoś podkusiło utemperowanie rosnącego konkurenta, to zwyczajnie nikt nie był w stanie sobie na to pozwolić. Żeby mimo wszystko zaznaczyć swoją obecność i wzmocnić pozycje, a przy okazji zwiększyć swoje wpływy, w momencie, gdy państwo było gotowe zaatakowano <a data-href=\"Kilikia\" href=\"places/countries/kilikia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kilikia</a> na południu. Wojna była krwawa i niezwykle brutalna. Kilikia ostatecznie się poddała, lecz nie została całkowicie wchłonięta – zachowała część autonomii. Plotki<br>\nOstatnio sporo mówi się o Tirtalyi na dworach całego cywilizowanego świata. Państwo świetnie prosperuje, jest całkiem potężne, ambitne i co ważne - przepełnione poczuciem niesprawiedliwości. Ludzie zaczynają się zastanawiać w którą stronę skierowane zostanie ostrze rodu Torcala. Oczywistą odpowiedzią wydaje się <a data-href=\"Perhyn\" href=\"places/countries/perhyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perhyn</a>. Choć boryka się z wewnętrznymi problemami, nadal byłby potężnym oponentem, zwłaszcza uwzględniając jego sojusz z <a data-href=\"Edonia\" href=\"places/countries/edonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edonia</a> i <a data-href=\"Yanthalei\" href=\"places/countries/yanthalei.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yanthalei</a>.

Podzielone na 2 domeny: Królestwo Głębin i Królestwo Piachów - jak określają to sami Yanthalejczycy. Dla ich władczyń zdecydowanie większe znaczenie posiada część skryta pod falami mórz. Terytoria nadwodne traktowane są jako przyczółek dyplomatyczny, tereny, które państwo musi posiadać, by móc wchodzić w interakcje z innymi państwami cywilizowanego świata. Stolica\nNowy Morvannon – miasto, odbudowane po całkowitym zniszczeniu przez Klątwę. Obecnie jest to olbrzymia metropolia łącząca oba świata trytonów. Władza<br>\nOd zarania państwa w Yanthalei panuje matriarchat(rzecz zwykła w społeczeństwach trytonów). Państwo posiada 2 władczynie: Królową Mórz i Królową Ziem. Z czego to Królowa Mórz posiada większą władzę - jest to tytuł dziedziczny, Królowa Ziem jest nominowana przez Królową Mórz. Jak nazwy wskazują - obie władczynią rządzą oddzielnymi częściami królestwa trytonów. Obie w swoich domenach są udzielnymi władczyniami, z wyłączeniem polityki zagranicznej - w tej kwestii wymagana jest współpraca obu królowych, wraz z królewskimi radami - przy czym ostateczny głos zawsze należy do Królowej Mórz. Obecnymi władczyniami są 2 wnuczki Callaxii: <a data-href=\"Thessafer\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Thessafer</a> - królowa mórz i <a data-href=\"Oaraviane\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oaraviane</a> - królowa ziem. <a data-href=\"Thessafer\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Thessafer</a> jest młodsza, jednak osobiście została wybrana przez Callaxie. Religia\nYanthaleiczycy oddają cześć głównemu panteonowi, ale najważniejsi dla nich bogowie są połączeni bezpośrednio z morskimi toniami. <br><a data-href=\"Gotrel\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gotrel</a> - bóg prądów morskich <br><a data-href=\"Zhenangi\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zhenangi</a> - bogini podwodnych wulkanów <br><a data-href=\"Ghaukari\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ghaukari</a> - bogini morskiej pustki Poddani\nPoddani królowych to głównie trytony. Tak przynajmniej zakładają wszystkie pozostałe państwa - nie sposób bowiem dowiedzieć się jak wielu mieszkańców kryją morskie tonie królowej Thessafer. Pomimo tego, że rasy żyjące nad wodą są ewidentnie obywatelami drugiej kategorii to nie widać wrogości państwa względem nich - w państwie brak jest konfliktów na tle rasowym. Od wielu lat mówi się, że Yanthalei jest olbrzymią potęgą. Ci, którym dane było dostąpić zaszczytu odwiedzin Podmorskich Dworów(niemal wyłącznie magowie) przynosili wieści o niezliczonych poddanych, olbrzymich armiach i olśniewających budynkach Ostatnie wydarzenia<br>\nWiadomo, że w latach 4003 - 4019 doszło do puczu, w wyniku którego zginęły Callaxia i jej córka - <a data-href=\"Egove\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Egove</a>.

Nie podobało mu się to jak inne państwa traktują państwo trytonów - po przejęciu władzy planował inwazje na Półwysep. Bunt zakończył się pokonaniem Irikina przez dwie wnuczki Callaxii wraz z drużyną poszukiwaczy przygód. Irikin uciekł, nikt go nie widział od tamtej pory.

Miałem, albo nadal mam młodszą siostrę, gdyż w dniu masakry na członkach rady i ich rodzinach, zginęła cała moja rodzina, ale ciała siostry nie udało mi się odnaleźć. Nie miałem tropu gdzie mogę jej szukać.<br>\nDuchy z miejsca masakry, potrzebują czasu, aby się ustabilizować i skupić w jedną spójną myśl, więc nie udało mi się nic dowiedzieć na temat tego co tam zaszło. Jeśli chodzi o dzieciństwo to pomimo tego, iż byłem starszym bratem to siostra była tym oczkiem w głowie rodziny i lokalnej społeczności, ponieważ była bardzo silna i utalentowana w posługiwaniu się bronią. Ja za to przejawiałem spirytystyczne umiejętności i byłem wyczulony na dostrzeganie tego co dzieje się po drugiej stronie zasłony oddzielającej świat materialny od duchowego. Dużo podróżowałem po świecie, poznając inne istoty ich kultury, przy okazji pomagając lokalnym zjawom znaleźć spokój.

You can use river carving mountains while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["rule_book/spells/create_correct_folders_for_content/one-action.html","rule_book/spells/spell_traits/uncommon.html","rule_book/classes/animist/animist.html","rule_book/spells/spell_traits/focus.html","rule_book/spells/spell_traits/water.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"src/action_one.png","fullURL":"rule_book/classes/animist/apparitions/spells/river-carving-mountains.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":["src/action_one.html"],"createdTime":1761147768269,"modifiedTime":1761157145968,"sourceSize":795,"sourcePath":"rule_book/classes/animist/apparitions/spells/River Carving Mountains.md","exportPath":"rule_book/classes/animist/apparitions/spells/river-carving-mountains.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":172,"backlinks":["rule_book/classes/animist/apparitions/vanguard-of-roaring-waters.html","rule_book/classes/animist/apparitions/spells/list-of-vessel-spells.html"],"type":"markdown"},"rule_book/classes/animist/apparitions/spells/store-time.html":{"title":"Store Time","icon":"","description":"STORE TIME <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"one-action\" href=\"rule_book/spells/create_correct_folders_for_content/one-action.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span src=\"src/action_one.png\" class=\"internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded\" target=\"_self\"></span></a><img src=\"src/action_one.png\" target=\"_self\"> FOCUS1<br>\n| <a data-href=\"UNCOMMON\" href=\"rule_book/spells/spell_traits/uncommon.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">UNCOMMON</a> | <a data-href=\"ANIMIST\" href=\"rule_book/classes/animist/animist.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ANIMIST</a> | <a data-href=\"FOCUS\" href=\"rule_book/spells/spell_traits/focus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">FOCUS</a> |Duration: sustained up to 1 minute You store time for later use.

You bond with spirits, manifesting their distinct magic and allowing their knowledge to flow through you. You may favor apparitions that grant you healing magic, others that grant you spells of destructive power, or pick and choose between different apparitions as your environment and circumstances demand. You may consider your powers part of a sacred trust or see your unique abilities as a sign that you’ve been chosen as a champion of two worlds. Whether you advocate for mortals in the planes beyond or whether you represent the spirits’ interests, you provide the bridge between realms.Wisdom At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Wisdom. 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.You channel the power of spiritual entities called apparitions to cast potent spells and manipulate the battlefield to your advantage. You mix divine magic and the spells granted to you by your attuned apparitions to cast down your enemies or sustain your allies.You watch and listen, letting the whispers of spirits and otherworldly beings guide you toward sound judgment.You use your patient attention to detail, alongside clues and special senses gifted to you by your spiritual allies, to detect threats before they can ambush your companions or to notice hidden treasures that others might pass by.You seek out areas close to otherworldly entities who bring you strength or comfort. You might tend to grave sites, tread primeval wildernesses, or ride the rivers and seas. Animists attuned to apparitions of wisdom and knowledge may spend their quiet hours in libraries or temples.\nTalk to spiritual entities only you can perceive.\nPrefer to speak in stories and descriptive anecdotes. Look at the world from a broader or more metaphorical perspective than most mortal creatures. Find you detached or absent-minded due to your focus on things beyond their awareness. Value your wisdom as someone with access to vast troves of experience beyond what a single person could normally accumulate. Mistake you for being cruel or lacking empathy because you give equal weight to the material and immaterial.\nAt 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.\nTrained in Perception Trained in Fortitude Trained in Reflex Expert in Will Trained in Religion Trained in either Nature or Occultism Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier Trained in simple weapons Trained in unarmed attacks Trained in light armor Trained in medium armor Trained in unarmored defense Trained in spell attack modifier\nTrained in spell DC Trained in animist class DC\nYou gain these abilities as an animist. Abilities gained at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to the features’ names.In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At Sth level and every § levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.Animists have a gift for divine magic that allows them to serve as conduits or bridges for otherworldly spiritual entities known collectively as apparitions; through them, these entities can commune and interact with the physical world in a process called attunement. Apparitions are myriad and diverse: they may be human spirits lingering on the border between becoming phantoms or ghosts, animal spirits with particularly strong connections to the physical world but lacking the malice that would spur a transition into true undeath, manifestations of natural locations that have grown thought and purpose over time, or they may be a different variation altogether. Some animists attune to one or more specific apparitions that accompany them in their travels, forming deep partnerships over time, while others adapt to their surroundings by befriending the local apparitions who dwell wherever the animist’s journey takes them. Each day during your daily preparations, choose two apparitions from the list on page 17 to attune to. Of these, choose one to be your primary apparition. Your attuned apparitions each grant you knowledge in the form of Lore skills and a repertoire of additional spells you can cast using apparition spellcasting (see below), and your primary apparition grants you even further power in the form a unique vessel focus spell and, when you are higher level, a unique avatar form. When you Refocus (Player Core 298), you can change which of your currently attuned apparitions is your primary apparition, selecting from any of the apparitions you attuned to during your daily preparations. All your apparitions typically remain attuned to you until your next daily preparations, but some animist abilities can temporarily disperse them, usually in exchange for a powerful boon. If an apparition is dispersed, you lose access to its gifts—you forget its apparition skills, its spells are removed from your apparition spell repertoire, and you can’t use its vessel spell or avatar form—until you attune to it again. When you disperse your primary apparition, one of your remaining apparitions becomes your primary apparition, chosen by you at the time of dispersal. See Animist Apparitions on page 17 for more information.The number before a plus sign indicates your spell slots via animist spellcasting, and the number after it indicates your spell slots from apparition spellcasting. For instance, a 2nd-level animist has “2+1” 1st-rank spell slots, meaning they can prepare two 1st-rank spells via animist spellcasting, and they also have one spell slot to spontaneously cast an apparition spell. * The supreme apparition class feature gives you a 10th-rank apparition slot that works a bit differently from other spells.Your role as a spiritual medium connecting the mortal Universe to the realms beyond lets you cast your magic in two distinct ways: you both learn and prepare spells from the divine tradition yourself, and you also channel the knowledge and power of your attuned apparitions, gaining spell slots and a repertoire of spells from them that you can cast spontaneously.\nRegardless of which source you’re drawing on, you are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an animist, your incantations might take the form of reciting relevant snippets of legends—stories passed down orally—or they might see you calling nearby spirits to honor ancient vows. Your gestures could be elegant dances or full-body convulsions as generations of memories and otherworldly energies inherited from your spiritual allies surge through you. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. The clearly delineated partnership between an animist and their apparitions means you can’t cast your animist spells using your apparition spell slots or vice versa— your magics remain complementary and harmonious, yet as distinct as the two worlds from which they come.As a keeper of knowledge, you are constantly learning new techniques and spells. Each day, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and 2 cantrips from among the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells you've gained access to and learned via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an animist, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Animist Spells per Day. You are a prepared spellcaster for the purposes of determining how you interact with staves and other items or effects that differentiate between prepared and spontaneous spellcasters.You can draw upon your attuned apparitions as a second source of magical knowledge and power. You gain additional spontaneous spell slots and a spell repertoire from your attuned apparitions. At first level, you can cast two apparition cantrips and one 1st-rank apparition spell per day. You must have the spell in your apparition spell repertoire to cast it; this is a collection of spells granted to you by all your attuned apparitions. You can cast any spell in your apparition spell repertoire by using an apparition spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Any of these spells that aren’t normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you cast them this way. As you increase in level, you gain further apparition spell slots, and your apparitions grant you higher-rank apparition spells, as detailed in each apparition entry.When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. All your apparition spells are signature spells. That means that you can heighten any apparition spell freely by casting it from a higher-rank apparition spell slot, up to the maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast.Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of animist spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level animist, your cantrips are Ist-rank spells, and as a Sth-level animist, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.Your primary attuned apparition can use your body as a conduit, allowing you to cast a unique vessel spell. Vessel spells are a type of focus spell. Because vessel spells are a manifestation of a specific apparition, an animist can’t cast or Sustain a specific vessel spell in the same round they have already cast or Sustained \"it (for example, an animist who has cast earth’s bile during their turn can’t then cast or Sustain another instance of earth’s bile during that same turn). It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to treat with nearby spirits, meditate on resolving an issue pertaining to the balance of spirits and mortals, or tell a story. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, though certain feats or abilities adjust this number, but it can never be more than 3 points.At 1st level, you choose an animistic practice that influences the way your power grows and develops, and you gain its first invocation. At 9th level, you gain its second invocation, and at 17th, you gain its third.You draw forth your apparitions through the power of song and dance, connecting the spiritual to the physical. These performances can be of your own creation or follow the specific rites of your religion. Song of Invocation (1st): You can sing out to the spirits to have them spin and twirl around you. You gain the Circle of Spirits feat. Dancing Invocation (9th): The movement of your body grants power to your magic. When you Leap, Step, or Tumble Through, you also Sustain an apparition spell or vessel spell. Invocation of Praise (17th): Your liturgies call to the spirits even in the heat of battle. When you roll initiative, you can use Circle of Spirits as a free action. If your first action on your first turn is to cast an apparition cantrip granted by your primary apparition, you reduce the number of actions it takes to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).\nYou are particularly good at acting as a conduit for spiritual energy and tend to associate more freely with a wide array of apparitions, though you tend not to form the deep bond with a single apparition that other animists often develop.\nInvocation of Unity (1st): The lines between your body and your apparition are blurry. You gain the Relinquish Control feat.\nDual Invocation (9th): You can build powerful bonds with multiple apparitions. You can select two of your attuned apparitions to be your primary apparitions. If you have the supreme incarnation class feature (page 17), you choose which apparition’s avatar form you manifest each time you cast the avatar spell. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool is equal to the number of focus spells you have or the number of primary apparitions you are attuned to, whichever is higher (maximum 3).\nInvocation of Synchronization (17th): The line between your intentions and those of the apparition possessing you blurs, leaving you better able to support each other in the throes of combat. While you have Relinquished Control to an apparition, you gain the following additional benefits: Once per round, you can attempt a Recall Knowledge check as a free action. All Strikes you make with a weapon or unarmed attack deal an additional 2 points of spirit damage. You gain resistance equal to half your level against all physical damage, but have weakness equal to your level to spirit damage. You are particularly sensitive to the presence and influence of spirits and undead. You can detect lingering spirits, offering you some defense against them.\nInvocation of Sight (1st): You shift your eyes easily to the spirit world, intuiting the needs of apparitions and other spiritual entities based on how they appear to you. You gain the Apparition Sense feat. You also gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws and AC against the effects of haunts and the abilities of spirits and incorporeal undead.\nInvocation of Protection (9th): Your status as an intermediary across planar boundaries grants you further defenses against spiritual ailments. You gain spirit resistance and void resistance equal to half your level, and your status bonus to saving throws and AC against the effects of haunts and the abilities of spirits and incorporeal undead increases to +2.\nInvocation of Resilience (17th): You are a bulwark against the terrible spirits that lurk in the dark. Your apparition sight becomes a precise sense and your status bonus to saving throws and AC against the effects of haunts and the abilities of spirits and incorporeal undead increases to +3.\nYou form close bonds with your apparitions that allow you to invest them with the rare ability to take on a material form and directly affect the physical world.\nInvocation of Embodiment (1st): You allow your apparition to inhabit a physical form. You gain the Spirit Familiar feat. At 2nd level, you gain the Enhanced Familiar feat.\nInvocation of Growth (9th): Your bond with the physical form of your chosen apparition grows stronger. You gain the Incredible Familiar feat.\nInvocation of Otherworldliness (17th): Your apparition familiar becomes ever more powerful, straddling the line between physical and spiritual. Your spirit familiar can take a single action that has the concentrate trait to become incorporeal for 1 minute. It gains the incorporeal trait, meaning it can move through physical creatures and such creatures can move through it. It can’t attempt Strength-based checks (such as Grapple) against corporeal creatures, and corporeal creatures can’t attempt such checks against it. It gains immunity to precision damage and resistance to physical damage (except damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune) equal to half your level (double against non-magical damage) but weakness to force damage equal to half your level. However, when incorporeal, your spirit familiar can travel no more than 60 feet from you and must maintain line of effect to you; this typically prevents it from moving through walls. Your spirit familiar can Dismiss this effect.\nYou'll see the following new key terms in many animist class features.Apparitions are spiritual entities who generally lack the power, cohesiveness, or attachments to enter or affect the physical world. Unlike a ghost or phantom, an apparition does not need to have ever been a living creature and could be the spiritual memory of a particularly meaningful location or event. Apparitions are reliant on animists to interact with other people and with things; they generally can't be targeted or affected by spells and abilities other than those of the animist they are attuned to. Animist feats and abilities that affect spirits affect apparitions only if they specifically say so. Animist abilities with the apparition trait involve one or more of your apparitions acting alongside you. You must be attuned to at least one apparition to use an apparition ability, and some abilities might state in their Requirements more specifically which apparition you must be attuned to. Typically, youre assumed to always attune to your apparitions during your daily preparations, but in some rare circumstances or as a result of certain animist abilities, your apparitions might be dispersed or separated from you for a time. You aren't attuned to dispersed apparitions.Wandering is a new trait that identifies animist feats attuned to particular types of apparitions. These feats may require you to be attuned to an apparition who matches their requirements when you select them and represent knowledge and ability pulled from that specific bond. When you make your daily preparations, you can retrain any wandering feat you know for any other wandering feat available at the level you took the exchanged feat (including lower-level wandering feats, as usual). You must meet all the new feat’s other prerequisites. In addition, the animist makes use of the stance trait, reprinted below for convenience:A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance.At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain an animist class feat.At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.Spiritual energy reinforces your body, making you more resilient. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.\nAt 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at Sth level and every 4 levels thereafter.The magic of the spirits flows freely through you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.You've learned to shelter more spirits, gaining access to more magic. When you ah “SPIRIT HOUSE attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose three apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3).Your apparitions call attention to minute details you might otherwise overlook. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.The spiritual entities that protect you warn you of harm before it would occur, giving you more time to react, and help bear the burden of your armor when it is necessary. Your proficiency rank for light armor, medium armor, unarmored defense, and Reflex saves increases to expert.Training and magical assistance from your spiritual companions have improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.Your apparitions gird your mind against hostile intrusion and shield you from the effects of entities seeking to control your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you’re legendary.You're truly loved by the spirits, with apparitions flocking to you from far and wide. When you attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose four apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3).Your affinity with the apparitions you bond to has further enhanced the potency of your magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.You are a near-perfect channel for the magical energies of the realms beyond. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.You become a nexus between the mortal and spiritual realms through which your apparition can embody its full might. You gain a 10th-rank apparition spell slot. In addition to heightened versions of your apparition spells, you can use this slot to cast avatar. When you cast avatar in this way, you do not become an avatar of a deity; rather, your primary attuned apparition incarnates itself using your body, transforming you into the avatar described in your primary attuned apparition’s entry.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"KEY ATTRIBUTE","level":4,"id":"KEY_ATTRIBUTE_0"},{"heading":"HIT POINTS","level":4,"id":"HIT_POINTS_0"},{"heading":"During combat encounters...","level":6,"id":"During_combat_encounters..._0"},{"heading":"During social encounters...","level":6,"id":"During_social_encounters..._0"},{"heading":"While exploring...","level":6,"id":"While_exploring..._0"},{"heading":"In downtime...","level":6,"id":"In_downtime..._0"},{"heading":"You might...","level":6,"id":"You_might..._0"},{"heading":"Others probably...","level":6,"id":"Others_probably..._0"},{"heading":"INITIAL PROFICIENCIES","level":4,"id":"INITIAL_PROFICIENCIES_0"},{"heading":"PERCEPTION","level":4,"id":"PERCEPTION_0"},{"heading":"SAVING THROWS","level":4,"id":"SAVING_THROWS_0"},{"heading":"SKILLS","level":4,"id":"SKILLS_0"},{"heading":"ATTACKS","level":4,"id":"ATTACKS_0"},{"heading":"DEFENSES","level":4,"id":"DEFENSES_0"},{"heading":"SPELLS","level":4,"id":"SPELLS_0"},{"heading":"CLASS DC","level":4,"id":"CLASS_DC_0"},{"heading":"ANIMIST ADVENCEMENT","level":4,"id":"ANIMIST_ADVENCEMENT_0"},{"heading":"CLASS FEATURES","level":2,"id":"CLASS_FEATURES_0"},{"heading":"Ancestry and Background","level":4,"id":"Ancestry_and_Background_0"},{"heading":"Attribute Boosts","level":4,"id":"Attribute_Boosts_0"},{"heading":"Initial Proficiencies","level":4,"id":"Initial_Proficiencies_0"},{"heading":"Apparition Attunement","level":4,"id":"Apparition_Attunement_0"},{"heading":"ANIMIST SPELLS PER DAY","level":4,"id":"ANIMIST_SPELLS_PER_DAY_0"},{"heading":"Animist &amp;

When you are attuned to an apparition, you are trained in these Lore skills, channeling the apparition into your body to share its knowledge on the subject.

are mystically bonded creatures tied to your magic. Most familiars were originally animals, though the ritual of becoming a familiar makes them something more. You can choose a Tiny animal you want as your familiar, such as a bat, cat, raven, or snake. Some familiars are different, usually described in the ability that granted you a familiar; for example, a druid’s leshy familiar is a Tiny plant instead of an animal, formed from a minor nature spirit. Familiars have the minion trait (page 634), so during an encounter, they gain 2 actions in a round if you spend an action to command them. If your familiar dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no cost. You can have only one familiar at a time.Modifiers and AC Your familiar’s save modifiers and AC are equal to yours before applying circumstance or status bonuses or penalties. Its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers are equal to your level plus your spellcasting ability modifier (Charisma if you don’t have one, unless otherwise specified). If it attempts an attack roll or other skill check, it uses your level as its modifier. It doesn’t have or use its own ability modifiers and can never benefit from item bonuses.Your familiar has 5 Hit Points for each of your levels.Your familiar is Tiny.Your familiar has low-light vision and can gain additional senses from familiar abilities. It can communicate empathically with you as long as it’s within 1 mile of you, sharing emotions. It doesn’t understand or speak languages normally, but it can gain speech from a familiar ability.Your familiar has either a Speed of 25 feet or a swim Speed of 25 feet (choose one upon gaining the familiar). It can gain other movement types from familiar abilities.Each day, you channel your magic into two abilities, which can be either familiar or master abilities. If your familiar is an animal that naturally has one of these abilities (for instance, an owl has a fly Speed), you must select that ability. Your familiar can’t be an animal that naturally has more familiar abilities than your daily maximum familiar abilities.\n<a data-href=\"FA_Amphibious\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">FA_Amphibious</a> It gains a swim Speed of 25 feet (or Speed of 25 feet if it already has a swim Speed). <br><a data-href=\"FA_Burrower\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">FA_Burrower</a> It gains a burrow Speed of 5 feet, allowing it to dig Tiny holes.\n<br><a data-href=\"FA_Climber\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">FA_Climber</a> It gains a climb Speed of 25 feet. <br><a data-href=\"FA_Damage Avoidance\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">FA_Damage Avoidance</a> Choose one type of save.

You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.

W okolicy powozu nie znaleźli żadnych ciał, strażników.

Ruszyli w głąb góry aż do głównej sali, w której znajdowała się klatka żywa klatka, która pobierała moc z czegoś wewnątrz i jednym \"macko przewodem\" podłączona była do portalu, a drugi wędrował gdzieś dalej.
