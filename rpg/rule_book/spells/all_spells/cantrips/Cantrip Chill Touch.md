___
Siphoning negative energy into yourself, your hand radiates a pale darkness. Your touch weakens the living and disorients undead, possibly even causing them to flee. The effect depends on whether the target is living or undead. 
- **Living Creature** The spell deals negative damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier. The target attempts a basic Fortitude save, but is also enfeebled 1 for 1 round on a critical failure.
- **Undead Creature** The target is flat-footed for 1 round on a failed Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the target is also fleeing for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save. 
___
**Heightened (+1)** The negative damage to living creatures increases by 1d4.
