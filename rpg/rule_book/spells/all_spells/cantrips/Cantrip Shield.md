**Traditions**: [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Cast:** [![](action_one.png)](one-action) [[verbal]] 
**Duration:** until the start of your next turn 
___
You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the **Raise a Shield** action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn’t require a hand to use.

While the spell is in effect, you can use the **Shield Block** reaction with your magic shield (see the sidebar). The shield has Hardness 5. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can’t cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell’s reaction against the magic missile spell.

Heightening the spell increases the shield’s Hardness.
___
- **Heightened (3rd)** The shield has Hardness 10.
- **Heightened (5th)** The shield has Hardness 15.
- **Heightened (7th)** The shield has Hardness 20.
- **Heightened (9th)** The shield has Hardness 25.

**SHIELD ACTIONS**

The shield spell works like a raised shield, and it also gives you the ability to use the Shield Block reaction.

**SHIELD BLOCK** [[action-reaction]]

Trigger While you have your shield raised, you take damage from a physical attack.
You place your shield to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s Hardness. You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.
