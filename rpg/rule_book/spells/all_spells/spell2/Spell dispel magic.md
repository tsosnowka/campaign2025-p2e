___
You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a counteract check against the target. If you successfully counteract a magic item, it becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. This doesn't change the item's non-magical properties. If the target is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.
