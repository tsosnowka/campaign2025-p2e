___
You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to detect via magic. Veil of privacy attempts to counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying effects used against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-rank spells for this purpose. Successfully counteracting a spell that targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects for only veil of privacy's target.
