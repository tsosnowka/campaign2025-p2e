___
You create a cloud of mesmerizing patterns and colors that hovers in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the cloud. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the cloud when you cast it, when it enters the cloud, when it ends its turn within the cloud, or if it uses a Seek or Interact action on the cloud. A creature currently fascinated by hypnotize doesn't attempt new saves.

- **Success:** The target is unaffected.
- **Failure:** The target is fascinated by the cloud.
- **Critical Failure:** The target is fascinated by the cloud. While it remains fascinated, it can't use reactions.
