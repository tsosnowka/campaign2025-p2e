Choose your apparitions—spiritual beings you entreat with and attune to, sharing in their knowledge and power.

### Reading an Apparition Entry
An apparition entry contains the following information.
###### Apparition Skills 
Each apparition has amassed knowledge on a particular set of Lore skills that cover their areas of interest and expertise. When you are attuned to an apparition, you are trained in these Lore skills, channeling the apparition into your body to share its knowledge on the subject. At 8th level and beyond, you can draw upon even more of the apparition’s knowledge, gaining expert proficiency in their apparition skills; at 16th level and beyond, your harmony of mind and spirit grants you master proficiency in their apparition skills.
###### Apparition Spell Repertoire
Your attuned apparitions each contribute a number of spells to your apparition spell repertoire. You add the spells of all your attuned apparitions together to create a spell repertoire, which you cast with your apparition spellcasting.
###### Vessel Spell
Your primary apparition grants you the listed vessel spell at 1st level.
###### Avatar
When you cast avatar using the apparition slot granted by the supreme incarnation class feature, you temporarily fuse with one of your primary attuned apparitions into a powerful battle form of near-deific power, using the limited stats here instead of a deity’s.
