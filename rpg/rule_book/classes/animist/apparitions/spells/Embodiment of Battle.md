Your apparition guides your attacks and imparts its skill to your movements. For the duration, your proficiency with martial weapons is equal to your proficiency with simple weapons, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls made with weapons or unarmed attacks, and you gain the Reactive Strike reaction (page 37); this reaction gains the apparition trait. The instincts of an apparition of battle run contrary to the use of magic; for the duration of this spell, you take a -2 status penalty to your spell attack modifiers and your spell DCs.
