RIVER CARVING MOUNTAINS [![](action_one.png)](one-action) FOCUS 1 
| [[UNCOMMON]] | [[ANIMIST]] | [[FOCUS]] | [[WATER]] |

**Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute 
___
Your apparition solidifies around you into roaring water and spraying mist. For the duration of this spell, you have lesser cover against ranged attacks and gain a +10-foot status bonus to each Speed you have. When you first cast this spell and each time you Sustain it, you can Stride up to your speed while your apparition fills each square you pass through with the lingering energy of a coursing river. These squares become difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. You can use river carving mountains while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
