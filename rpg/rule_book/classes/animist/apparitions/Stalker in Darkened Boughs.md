Stalkers in darkened boughs make their homes in ancient forests and jungles unfriendly to humanoids and others who would exert control or influence over nature’s designs. These apparitions are drawn to animists who harbor violent thoughts or impulses but are more likely to linger with animists who can quell their hatred. Stalkers in darkened boughs are moody, impulsive, and prone to seeing things from the least charitable perspective.
