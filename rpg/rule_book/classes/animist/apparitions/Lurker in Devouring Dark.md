Lurkers in devouring dark are most often near old shipwrecks, deadly icebergs, and other places where ice and deep water are most prevalent. In places where the Dark Tapestry intrudes upon the world, there can be found variant lurkers in devouring dark who offer Dark Tapestry Lore in place of Sailing Lore and whose spells of water and ice instead deal void damage.
