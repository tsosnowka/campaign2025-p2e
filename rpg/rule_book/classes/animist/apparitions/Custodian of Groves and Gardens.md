Custodians of groves and gardens frequent tended greenery and farmlands cared for by loving stewards, and other places of reflection and restoration where green things grow. Some of these apparitions linger in the mortal realms not because they have lost their way, but because they believe they have already found Elysium. Others are the cultivated spiritual essence of the location itself. Custodians of groves and gardens are peaceful, quiet, and averse to conflict.
